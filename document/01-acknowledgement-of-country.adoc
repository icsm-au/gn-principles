== Acknowledgement of Country

We acknowledge the diverse Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities across Australia and their continued connection to land.

There are many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages and naming systems across Australia that have been in place for thousands of years.

Many names from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages have become official names, used by all Australians.
