== Australian Place Naming Principles
=== Place naming across Australia is consistent
All geographical features and areas, roads and localities in Australia should be named in a
consistent way for the effective delivery of services and to enhance community cohesion.
Jurisdictions can name other places as required by their legislation and policies.

==== Language
All place names should::
. Be written in standard Australian English or, in an appropriate format for Aboriginal or
Torres Strait Islander languages.
. Use the standard Australia alphabet.
. Have consistent spelling for names derived from the same source, e.g. Matodoro ridge
and Matodoro trail.
. Be easy to pronounce and spell.
. Exceptions to the above may be appropriate for place names derived from different
cultures Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages.

Place names should not::
. Contain numbers, roman numerals, punctuation, abbreviations, acronyms or similar.
. Start with the word ‘the’.
. Contain cardinal indicators or qualifying terms, e.g. North, Southern, Upper, New. +

=== Place naming information is accurate and accessible

As place names are a key descriptor in databases supporting a broad range of services,
including emergency services, place naming information should be accurate, timely and readily
accessible.

==== Accessible
. Place names must be assigned by a relevant naming authority in each State or
Territory.
. Published in a gazetteer,
. Enduring, changes to existing names should only be considered when there is a
compelling reason to do so.

==== Unique
. Avoiding duplication, a place name is a duplicate if it is identical with, or similar
(in spelling or pronunciation) to another place name of the same feature type.
. Uniqueness is particularly important for names forming a component of a street
address, such as road and locality names. A road name, regardless of road type,
should not duplicate an existing road name in the same locality, an adjoining
locality, or in the same local government area. A new locality name should not
duplicate any other locality name in Australia.

==== Clearly described
. A place name should have a clear description, that includes the extent of the
feature it represents. The description should as much as possible align with the
place names vocabulary (provide link).
. Information to be captured includes the type of feature being named, eg, river,
road or lake.
. The description may also have associated origin information, including the
reasoning for the name, any attached stories or background. For Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander names, a recording of the pronunciation is encouraged.

==== Places which cross State / Territory / jurisdictional boundaries
. The name for any feature that crosses a State / Territory / jurisdictional boundary
should be the same on both sides of that boundary and be decided by consensus
with all responsible naming authorities.

==== Offshore Places
. States and Territories are responsible for the naming of island, water and
undersea places within their legislated Coastal Waters and internal waters. The
Australian Hydrographic Office should be advised of proposed, new and amended
offshore place names for charting purposes.
. Refer to the Australian Hydrographic Office for advice on the appropriate naming
authority for offshore place names outside of Coastal Waters.
. Limits of oceans and seas – as per ICSM Resolution R00/11/06, May 2001 –
Changes to limits and nomenclature of the Oceans and Seas surrounding Australia
require the approval of the ICSM before being forwarded to the International
Hydrographic Organisation.

==== Road names
. The naming of roads should follow all principles in this document and:
. All built public and private roads should be named,
. A road should only have one name, other than part of a highway that is assigned
a local name where it passes through a town or city. This includes where a road
crosses administrative boundaries.
. A road name should apply from one end of the road to the other i.e. the point
where the road finishes or intersects with another road or roads.
. A road name should include a road type, please refer to the road types
vocabulary, e.g. Smith Street where street is the road type.
. When a road is changed and it is no longer continuous, new names should be
applied as appropriate to avoid confusion.

=== Place names promote connection, inclusivity and the rights of others

Place names promoting diversity and cultural inclusivity are encouraged. Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander names in particular play an important role in reawakening language and culture.
This may include the reinstating of Traditional place names, or the creation of new names
derived from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's diverse languages.

==== Connection
. Place names should have a connection to the feature or area they represent.

==== Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Place Names
. Any place naming action should seek permission from the relevant Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the custodians of their language and culture,
with consideration to the right to control their use.

==== Dual Naming
. Dual names are a way to assign two names, with two different cultural origins, to
a geographical feature.
. Dual names should not be applied to roads or localities.
. Both names should be displayed on official maps and signage.
. Dual names should be represented by name, space, forward slash (/), space,
name e.g. Uluru / Ayers Rock.

==== Commemorative Names
. Place names can commemorate a person(s) or significant event and should
have a connection to the place.
. When commemorating a person(s) the name must be applied posthumously.
Acts of bravery, community service and exceptional accomplishments are typical
grounds for commemorating a person through place naming.
. The place name should not include titles, honorifics or postnominals. For
example: John Smith Park not John Smith AO Park, or Jane Smith Park not Dr Jane
Smith Park.

==== Unacceptable names
. Place names must not be derogatory, discriminatory, frivolous, offensive, or in
poor taste.
. Contrived names should not be used, e.g combining two family names to create
a single place name.
. Place names should not be perceived as promoting commercial, or business
interests.
. Place names should not include words protected or restricted by
Commonwealth or other legislation, unless the appropriate approvals are sought,
e.g the term ANZAC, Royal and Defence words.
. Place names should not infringe on any established or implied rights, e.g.
copyright, trademarks and Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property (ICIP).

==== Consultation
. The impacted community or communities should be consulted for all new or
altered place names.
. If using Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander language in a place name, it is
important to engage in culturally appropriate consultation to obtain consent to use
the name and record the meaning or story associated with the name.
. Consent may also be required to capture supporting information, including
historical background, spelling, information on pronunciation, origins, intellectual
property, and cultural heritage.
