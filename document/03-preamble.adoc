== Preamble

=== Foreword
In Australia there is no overarching naming authority. The ICSM PNWG brings together place naming (geographical naming) authorities from both Australia and New Zealand, working collaboratively to establish modern, inclusive, and consistent practices that reflect the evolving needs and values of our diverse communities. The PNWG has developed the Australian Place Naming Principles to provide a consistent and unified approach to place naming across the country.

These principles replace previous ones, the "Principles for the Consistent Use of Place Names" <<PCUPN>>, and are designed to address contemporary community expectations, with a particular focus on safety, cultural sensitivity and inclusivity. It recognises the critical role geographical naming plays in supporting a range of functions, including economic development, research, conservation, service delivery, and in reflecting the cultural identity and values of Australia.

Aligned with the resolutions set out by the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names, the principles adhere to international best practices while supporting Australian government authorities in updating and aligning local geographical naming policies. This ensures greater effectiveness in public services and better represents the diverse communities across the nation.

The PNWG advocates for geographical naming that is inclusive and reflective of the diversity within our communities. In particular, the group acknowledges the significance of geographical names in promoting the wider use and appreciation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages and cultures.

While this document provides valuable guidance, the PNWG recognises that each state and territory in Australia has its own policies and practices. This document does not address the determination of state or territory names and boundaries, or Traditional First Nations Country or language group names and boundaries.

=== #Scope#

This document is a Profile of <<ISO19160-2, ISO 19160-2:2023, Addressing – Part 2: Assigning and maintaining addresses for objects in the physical world>>.

In the Australian context, this standard applies to thoroughfare-based addressing i.e. street and water, as well as landmark addressing. It is designed as a replacement for <<ANZ4819, AS/NZS 4819:2011 Rural and urban addressing>>. This standard does not apply to other address classes such as postal at this time. Postal addressing is expected to adhere to <<ASNZSISO19160-4, AS/NZS ISO 19160.4:2023 International postal address components and template language>>.

This document focuses on assigning and maintaining addresses that allow the unambiguous determination of an object in the physical world for purposes of identification and location in the context of public administration and public service delivery.

This standard provides requirements for addressing authorities to assign addresses, record the related information, and signage related to addressing components.

=== #Conformance#

Keywords used to signify requirements in this document are those defined by <<RFC2119, RFC2119>> and they are:

* _MUST_
* _MUST NOT_
* _REQUIRED_
* _SHALL_
* _SHALL NOT_
* _SHOULD_
* _SHOULD NOT_
* _RECOMMENDED_
* _MAY_

For process and information to be conformant with this standard, the imperatives of those keywords _MUST_ be followed as per their <<RFC2119, RFC2119>> definitions.

Address information created following processes outlined in this standard _MUST_ conform to the <<ADDR2024, ICSM Address Model>> with conformance to it tested as per it's https://linked.data.gov.au/def/addr#AnnexB[Annex B: Validation] section.

=== #Namespaces#

Namespaces, in this document's context, are managed <<IRI, IRIs>> which allow further IRIs to be created within their scope. Namespaces are allocated to macro data objects and provide IRIs for all the micro data objects within that object.

For example, the IRI for the <<ADDR2024, Address Model>> is `+https://linked.data.gov.au/def/addr+` and the namespace of `+https://linked.data.gov.au/def/addr/+` (the Address Model's IRI + `/`) allows for IRIs to be created for elements within the model such as one for the `AddressableObject` class which is `+https://linked.data.gov.au/def/addr/AddressableObject+`.

When used in some forms of data and human-readable text, IRIs can either be written in full or in a shortened form using prefixes for known namespace. For example, the `Addresable Object` mentioned above can be written in full like this:

`+https://linked.data.gov.au/def/addr/AddressableObject+`

or in prefixed form with the prefix `addr` for the namespace `+https://linked.data.gov.au/def/addr/+` like this:

`addr:AddressableObject`

The prefixed namespaces used in this document are:
